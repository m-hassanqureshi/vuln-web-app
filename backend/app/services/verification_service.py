"""Email-verification business logic (token issue / verify / resend).

This is the only module that touches the verification columns on the ``users``
table. It is the email-verification analog of ``oauth_service.py``: the route
layer in ``api/routes/auth.py`` calls these functions and renders/redirects on
the result.

Security posture (all preserved from the closed vulnerabilities):
- VULN-1 (SQL Injection): every SELECT/UPDATE here is parameterized -- never
  concatenate.
- VULN-3 (Reflected XSS): the token is never reflected back to the client; the
  /verify route renders a fixed outcome message, not the token.
- VULN-7 / VULN-8: the resend entry point is reached only via ``POST
  /verify/resend``, which the existing rate-limit + CSRF middleware already
  guard. This module adds no new auth surface of its own.

Token model (Option A -- stateful):
- ``secrets.token_urlsafe(32)`` (256-bit) stored raw in ``verification_token``.
- ``verification_token_expires`` is ``time.time()`` + TTL (default 1 hour).
- A successful verify clears both columns, making the link single-use.
