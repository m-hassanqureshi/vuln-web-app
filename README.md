# Vulnerable Web Application Build via Claude Code

An intentionally vulnerable web application designed to teach common security vulnerabilities through hands-on exploitation. Rather than studying vulnerabilities in theory, you'll exploit them in a working application to understand how real attacks work.

Built with FastAPI and SQLite — simple enough to read in one sitting, realistic enough to demonstrate actual attack techniques.

**Live Demo of v0.1.0:** https://vuln-web-app.onrender.com

> **WARNING:** This application is deliberately insecure. It is designed for educational use only and should never be deployed to production or used on systems you do not own.

## Releases & Versions

This repository ships in several tagged releases. The versions below are the main anchors — pick the one that matches how you want to learn:

| Version | Who it's for | What you get |
|---------|--------------|--------------|
| **v0.1.0** | Students who want to fix the vulnerabilities **from scratch** | The baseline vulnerable app with **all 8 intentional vulnerabilities open** (including the MD5 weak password storage). Your job is to find and patch each one yourself. |
| **v0.1.1** | Students who want a **partial reference implementation** | Adds the **dark mode toggle** and replaces MD5 with **bcrypt** (VULN-5 fixed). A good starting point for comparing your own early fixes. |
| **v1.0.0** | Students who want the **complete reference implementation** | All **8 vulnerabilities fixed** (SQLi, stored & reflected XSS, session hijacking, weak passwords, exposed DB, no rate limiting, CSRF). Study it to see how every patch was implemented. |
| **v1.0.1** | Students who want the complete reference **plus the first feature enhancement** | Everything in v1.0.0 plus the **password strength meter** on the signup form (real-time bar + live 5-criterion checklist, advisory only — the backend gate is unchanged). |
| **v1.0.2** | Students who want the reference **plus the user profile page** | Everything in v1.0.1 plus the authenticated **User Profile Page** (`/profile`): view your username/email and change your password (current-password check + bcrypt, with a server-enforced strength policy). CSRF-protected, rate-limited, no schema change. |
| **v1.0.3** | Students who want the reference **plus social login** | Everything in v1.0.2 plus **Continue with Google** (OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code flow via Authlib + OpenID Connect): new accounts are auto-created and matching emails linked, and login reuses the existing signed session. The project's **first database-schema change**; the app still runs (and the button shows a setup page) when Google isn't configured. |
| **v1.0.4** | Students who want the reference **plus email verification** | Everything in v1.0.3 plus **Email Verification on Signup**: registration sends a single-use, 1-hour confirmation link over SMTP (stdlib only, no new dependency); accounts are created *unverified* and **cannot log in until the link is clicked**, with a credential-checked **Resend** button on the login page. Google accounts are auto-verified; the signup page shows a friendly setup page when SMTP isn't configured. Second DB-schema change (3 columns on `users`). |

The incremental tags between them (**v0.1.2 – v0.1.7**) each close one additional vulnerability — see the [Bug Fixes](#bug-fixes) table for the version-by-version mapping. The feature-enhancement tags build on top of v1.0.0: **v1.0.1** adds the password strength meter, **v1.0.2** the User Profile Page, **v1.0.3** Continue with Google, and **v1.0.4** Email Verification on Signup.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) package manager

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/arifpucit/vuln-web-app.git
cd vuln-web-app

# Check out the version you want (see "Releases & Versions" above)
git checkout v0.1.0   # baseline (all open) — or v0.1.1 (partial) / v1.0.0 (all fixed)

# Install dependencies
uv sync
```

### Running the Application

From the project root:
```bash
uv run backend/app/main.py
```

The app starts at **http://localhost:3001**. The database file (`vulnerable_app.db`) is created automatically on first run.

---

## Continue with Google — Setup (optional)

The app runs fine **without** any Google setup: username/password login works as
always, and the "Continue with Google" button simply shows a friendly
"not configured" page. To actually enable Google sign-in, give the app a Google
OAuth client:

1. **Create a project** — open the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/), create a new project, then **select/open it** (it must be the active project).
2. **Configure the consent screen** — in **Google Auth Platform** (older UI: *APIs & Services → OAuth consent screen*), work through the horizontal steps **App information → Audience → Contact → Finish**. Google blocks client creation until this is done.
3. **Make it usable** — either **Publish app** (Audience page → *In production*) so any Google account can sign in, or keep it in *Testing* and add your Google email under **Audience → Test users**. (Only basic `openid`/`email`/`profile` scopes are used, so no Google verification is required.)
4. **Create the OAuth client** — **Clients → Create client → Web application**. Under **Authorized redirect URIs** add this **exact** value (scheme, host, port, path — no trailing slash):
   ```
   http://localhost:3001/auth/google/callback
   ```
5. **Add the credentials locally** — copy the template and fill in your values:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # then edit .env:
   #   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=...apps.googleusercontent.com
   #   GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=...
   ```
6. **Restart** — `uv run backend/app/main.py`. The Google button now works.

---

## Email Verification — Setup (required for sign-up)

As of **v1.0.4**, creating a username/password account sends a confirmation
email, and the account **cannot log in until the link is clicked** (the login
page then offers a credential-checked "Resend verification email" button).
Because sign-up depends on email, the signup page shows a friendly **"sign-up
isn't available yet"** page until you configure an SMTP server. (Login for
already-verified accounts and **Continue with Google** still work without SMTP;
Google accounts are auto-verified.)

The app uses Python's standard-library SMTP client — **no extra dependency**.
The easiest provider is Gmail with an App Password:

1. **Enable 2-Step Verification** on the Google account (required before app
   passwords exist): https://myaccount.google.com/security
2. **Create an App Password** — https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords —
   name it e.g. `vuln-web-app`. Google shows a **16-character** password once.
3. **Add the credentials locally** — copy the template and fill in your values:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # then edit .env:
   #   SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
   #   SMTP_PORT=587
   #   SMTP_USER=your-address@gmail.com
   #   SMTP_PASSWORD=your-16-char-app-password
   #   SMTP_FROM=your-address@gmail.com
   #   APP_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001
   ```
4. **Restart** — `uv run backend/app/main.py`. Sign-up now sends verification
   emails, and the link in the email (valid 1 hour) confirms the account.

The verification token is a single-use, 1-hour `secrets.token_urlsafe(32)`
value stored on the user's row; `APP_BASE_URL` is the public origin used to
build the link. The real `.env` is **git-ignored** — never commit your secret;
`.env.example` holds placeholders only.

## Intentional Vulnerabilities

| # | Vulnerability | OWASP Category | Location | Status |
|---|---------------|----------------|----------|--------|
| 1 | SQL Injection | A03:2021 - Injection | `auth_service.py` — string concatenation in queries | **Closed** |
| 2 | Stored XSS | A03:2021 - Injection | `auth.py` — was unescaped username on dashboard; now HTML-escaped before output | **Closed** |
| 3 | Reflected XSS | A03:2021 - Injection | `auth.py` — was unescaped query param in search; now HTML-escaped before output | **Closed** |
| 4 | Session Hijacking | A07:2021 - Auth Failures | `main.py` — was a hardcoded secret key; now sourced from `SECRET_KEY` env var with a strong random fallback | **Closed** |
| 5 | Weak Password Storage | A02:2021 - Crypto Failures | `security.py` — was MD5 (no salt); now bcrypt (cost 12) | **Closed** |
| 6 | Exposed Database | A01:2021 - Access Control | `auth.py` — unauthenticated `/download/db` (route removed) | **Closed** |
| 7 | No Rate Limiting | A07:2021 - Auth Failures | `core/rate_limit.py` + `main.py` — was no throttling; now per-IP sliding-window limit on every POST (HTTP 429 when exceeded) | **Closed** |
| 8 | CSRF | A01:2021 - Access Control | `core/csrf.py` + `main.py` + form templates — was no CSRF tokens on forms; now per-session synchronizer token validated on every POST (HTTP 403 when missing or mismatched) | **Closed** |

## Learning Path

1. **Explore the app** — Sign up, log in, and navigate the dashboard to understand normal functionality.
2. **Read the source code** — Each vulnerability is commented in the code with its vulnerability number.
3. **Exploit each flaw** — Use the vulnerability table above to locate and exploit each one.
4. **Fix it** — Patch each vulnerability using secure coding practices: parameterized queries, output escaping, strong password hashing, rate limiting, and CSRF tokens.

## Bug Fixes
The **weak password storage** bug (VULN-5: MD5 → bcrypt) is **fixed** as of **v0.1.1**, the **SQL injection** vulnerability (VULN-1: string concatenation → parameterized queries) is **fixed** as of **v0.1.2**, the **exposed database** endpoint (VULN-6: unauthenticated `/download/db` → route removed) is **fixed** as of **v0.1.3**, the **session hijacking** vulnerability (VULN-4: hardcoded session secret → env-sourced secret with a strong random fallback) is **fixed** as of **v0.1.4**, the **stored XSS** vulnerability (VULN-2: unescaped dashboard username → HTML-escaped output) is **fixed** as of **v0.1.5**, the **reflected XSS** vulnerability (VULN-3: unescaped `/search` reflection → HTML-escaped output) is **fixed** as of **v0.1.6**, the **no rate limiting** vulnerability (VULN-7: no throttling → per-IP sliding-window POST rate limit returning HTTP 429) is **fixed** as of **v0.1.7**, and the **CSRF** vulnerability (VULN-8: no CSRF tokens → per-session synchronizer-token middleware returning HTTP 403) is **fixed** as of **v1.0.0**. **All 8 vulnerabilities are now closed**; the current codebase is a complete reference implementation. To study the original vulnerabilities, check out the `v0.1.0` tag (fully vulnerable baseline) and patch them yourself.

| # | Vulnerability | Description | Status |
|---|---------------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Weak Password Storage | Passwords were hashed with unsalted MD5; replaced with bcrypt (cost 12). Login now verifies the hash in Python instead of matching it in the SQL query. | **Fixed (v0.1.1)** |
| 2 | SQL Injection | `auth_service.py` builds queries with raw string concatenation; crafted input can read data or bypass authentication. Fix with parameterized/prepared queries. | **Fixed (v0.1.2)** |
| 3 | Stored XSS | `auth.py` rendered the username on the dashboard without escaping, so a malicious script persisted in the database and executed for every viewer. Fixed by HTML-escaping the username (`html.escape(..., quote=True)`) before output; the raw value still lives in the DB (output-encoding fix, not input filtering). | **Fixed (v0.1.5)** |
| 4 | Reflected XSS | The `/search` endpoint echoed the `q` parameter (and result rows / error text) back unescaped, executing injected scripts in the victim's browser. Fixed by HTML-escaping every reflected sink (`html.escape(..., quote=True)`); the raw values still live in the URL/DB (output-encoding fix, not input filtering). | **Fixed (v0.1.6)** |
| 5 | Session Hijacking | `main.py` used a hardcoded session secret key, making session cookies guessable/forgeable. Fixed by loading `SECRET_KEY` from the environment with a strong `secrets.token_hex(32)` random fallback, so a fresh checkout never ships a known key. | **Fixed (v0.1.4)** |
| 6 | Exposed Database | `/download/db` served the entire SQLite file with no authentication or authorization. Fixed by removing the route entirely. | **Fixed (v0.1.3)** |
| 7 | No Rate Limiting | There was no throttling middleware, leaving login open to brute-force and credential-stuffing attacks. Fixed by adding a stdlib `RateLimitMiddleware` that enforces a per-IP sliding window on every POST (default 5 requests / 60 s), returning HTTP 429 with a `Retry-After` header before the handler runs. | **Fixed (v0.1.7)** |
| 8 | CSRF | Forms carried no CSRF tokens, allowing cross-site request forgery against authenticated users. Fixed by adding a stdlib pure-ASGI `CSRFMiddleware` plus a per-session synchronizer token (`secrets.token_urlsafe(32)`) stored in `request.session["csrf_token"]`, spliced into a hidden field in the login and signup forms by the GET handlers, and validated on every POST with `secrets.compare_digest` — mismatches return HTTP 403 before the handler runs. | **Fixed (v1.0.0)** |

## Feature Enhancements

The dark mode toggle (v0.1.1), password strength meter (v1.0.1), User Profile Page (v1.0.2), Continue with Google (v1.0.3), and Email Verification on Signup (v1.0.4) are **done** — see the Status column. The remaining items are **planned**.

| # | Feature | Description | Status |
|---|---------|-------------|--------|
| 0 | Dark Mode Toggle | Light/dark theme toggle on login, signup, and dashboard pages; preference saved in `localStorage`, restored before first paint to avoid FOUC, with `prefers-color-scheme` fallback. | **Done (v0.1.1)** |
| 1 | Password Strength Meter | A real-time, frontend-only indicator on the signup form: a colored bar (Very Weak → Strong), a live checklist of five acceptance criteria (min length 8, lowercase, uppercase, digit, special character), and a `data-theme`-aware color palette. Advisory only — the backend still accepts any non-empty password. | **Done (v1.0.1)** |
| 2 | User Profile Page | Authenticated `/profile` page: view your username and email (read-only) and change your password (current-password check + bcrypt). The new password must meet the same five-criteria strength policy as signup (length ≥ 8 plus lower/upper/digit/special), enforced client- and server-side (no meter widget shown). CSRF-protected, rate-limited, no schema change. Dark-mode stays per-browser (`localStorage`). | **Done (v1.0.2)** |
| 3 | Email Verification on Signup | Registration sends a confirmation email with a single-use, 1-hour `secrets.token_urlsafe(32)` link (stdlib `smtplib`, no new dependency). New accounts are created **unverified** and **cannot log in until the link is clicked** — the login page then offers a CSRF-protected, rate-limited, credential-checked **Resend** button. Google accounts are auto-verified; existing accounts are grandfathered; the signup page degrades to a friendly setup page when SMTP isn't configured. Second DB-schema change (3 columns). | **Done (v1.0.4)** |
| 4 | Continue with Google (OAuth 2.0) | Sign up / log in with a Google account via the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code flow (Authlib + OpenID Connect). New users are auto-created and existing emails are linked; login uses the **existing signed session** (no JWT, one cookie). The OAuth `state` param is the flow's CSRF defense. Credentials come from a git-ignored `.env`; with none set, the button shows a friendly setup page and the rest of the app still runs. First DB-schema change (4 nullable columns on `users`). | **Done (v1.0.3)** |
| 5 | MFA via Authenticator App (TOTP) | Add two-factor authentication using a TOTP authenticator app (e.g., Google Authenticator or Authy) with QR-code enrollment. | Planned |
| 6 | OTP via Email | Send a one-time passcode to the user's registered email as a second authentication factor during login. | Planned |
| 7 | QR Code Login | Let users log in by scanning a QR code shown on the login page from an already-authenticated mobile device. | Planned |
| 8 | CAPTCHA on Login | Add a CAPTCHA (e.g., Google reCAPTCHA or hCaptcha) to the login form to block automated and bot-driven login attempts. | Planned |
| 9 | Account Lockout | Temporarily lock an account after a configured number of consecutive failed login attempts, with a cooldown timer before retry. | Planned |
