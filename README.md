# Vulnerable Web Application Build via Claude Code

An intentionally vulnerable web application designed to teach common security vulnerabilities through hands-on exploitation. Rather than studying vulnerabilities in theory, you'll exploit them in a working application to understand how real attacks work.

Built with FastAPI and SQLite — simple enough to read in one sitting, realistic enough to demonstrate actual attack techniques.

**Live Demo of v0.1.0:** https://vuln-web-app.onrender.com

> **WARNING:** This application is deliberately insecure. It is designed for educational use only and should never be deployed to production or used on systems you do not own.

## Releases & Versions

This repository ships in two tagged releases. Pick the one that matches how you want to learn:

| Version | Who it's for | What you get |
|---------|--------------|--------------|
| **v0.1.0** | Students who want to fix the vulnerabilities **from scratch** | The baseline vulnerable app with **all 8 intentional vulnerabilities open** (including the MD5 weak password storage). Your job is to find and patch each one yourself. |
| **v0.1.1** | Students who want to **study a reference implementation** | Adds the **dark mode toggle** and replaces MD5 with **bcrypt** (VULN-5 fixed). Use it to compare against your own fixes or to see how the bcrypt patch was implemented. |

### Download the version you want

**Option A — Download a release archive (no Git required)**

- v0.1.0: https://github.com/arifpucit/vuln-web-app/releases/tag/v0.1.0
- v0.1.1: https://github.com/arifpucit/vuln-web-app/releases/tag/v0.1.1

Download the `Source code (zip)` or `Source code (tar.gz)` asset for the version you want and extract it.

**Option B — Clone the repo and check out the tag**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arifpucit/vuln-web-app.git
cd vuln-web-app

# Work on the fully vulnerable baseline from scratch
git checkout v0.1.0

# Or study the version with dark mode + bcrypt
git checkout v0.1.1
```

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) package manager

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/arifpucit/vuln-web-app.git
cd vuln-web-app

# Check out the version you want (see "Releases & Versions" above)
git checkout v0.1.0   # or: git checkout v0.1.1

## Learning Path

1. **Explore the app** — Sign up, log in, and navigate the dashboard to understand normal functionality.
2. **Read the source code** — Each vulnerability is commented in the code with its vulnerability number.
3. **Exploit each flaw** — Use the vulnerability table above to locate and exploit each one.
4. **Fix it** — Patch each vulnerability using secure coding practices: parameterized queries, output escaping, strong password hashing, rate limiting, and CSRF tokens.

## Useful Commands

Check the database contents:
```bash
sqlite3 vulnerable_app.db "SELECT * FROM users;"
```

Reset the database (delete and restart):
```bash
rm vulnerable_app.db
uv run backend/app/main.py
```

Free port 3001 if already in use:
```bash
# macOS / Linux
lsof -ti:3001 | xargs kill

# Windows (PowerShell)
Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 3001 | Select-Object OwningProcess
Stop-Process -Id <PID> -Force
```

## Bug Fixes
The **weak password storage** bug (VULN-5: MD5 → bcrypt) and **SQL injection** vulnerability (VULN-1: string concatenation → parameterized queries) are **already fixed** as of **v0.1.1**. The remaining **six** vulnerabilities below are **still open** and are the ones you should patch.

| # | Vulnerability | Description | Status |
|---|---------------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Weak Password Storage | Passwords were hashed with unsalted MD5; replaced with bcrypt (cost 12). Login now verifies the hash in Python instead of matching it in the SQL query. | **Fixed (v0.1.1)** |
| 2 | SQL Injection | `auth_service.py` builds queries with raw string concatenation; crafted input can read data or bypass authentication. Fix with parameterized/prepared queries. | **Fixed** |
| 3 | Stored XSS | `auth.py` renders the username on the dashboard without escaping, so a malicious script persists in the database and executes for every viewer. Fix with output escaping/template auto-escape. | Open |
| 4 | Reflected XSS | The `/search` endpoint echoes the `q` parameter back unescaped, executing injected scripts in the victim's browser. Fix by escaping reflected output. | Open |
| 5 | Session Hijacking | `main.py` uses a hardcoded session secret key, making session cookies guessable/forgeable. Fix by loading a strong, random secret from the environment. | Open |
| 6 | Exposed Database | `/download/db` serves the entire SQLite file with no authentication or authorization. Fix by removing the route or restricting it behind admin auth. | Open |
| 7 | No Rate Limiting | There is no throttling middleware, leaving login open to brute-force and credential-stuffing attacks. Fix by adding per-IP/per-user rate limiting. | Open |
| 8 | CSRF | Forms carry no CSRF tokens, allowing cross-site request forgery against authenticated users. Fix by issuing and validating CSRF tokens on all state-changing requests. | Open |

## Feature Enhancements

The dark mode toggle is **done** (shipped in v0.1.1). The remaining items are **planned**.

| # | Feature | Description | Status |
|---|---------|-------------|--------|
| 0 | Dark Mode Toggle | Light/dark theme toggle on login, signup, and dashboard pages; preference saved in `localStorage`, restored before first paint to avoid FOUC, with `prefers-color-scheme` fallback. | **Done (v0.1.1)** |
| 1 | User Profile Page | A page where authenticated users can view and save their personal information and account settings. This also moves the dark-mode preference from per-browser (`localStorage`) to **per-user** — stored on the account so the theme choice follows the user across browsers and devices. | Planned |
| 2 | Email Verification on Signup | During registration, send a confirmation email containing a verification token/link to confirm the address actually exists; the account is activated only after the user clicks the link. | Planned |
| 3 | Password Strength Meter | A real-time indicator on the signup form that displays password strength and the acceptance criteria (length, complexity, character classes) as the user types. | Planned |
| 4 | Change Password | A dedicated page that lets authenticated users change their password, verifying the current password before setting a new one. | Planned |
| 5 | Continue with Google (OAuth 2.0) | Allow users to sign up and log in using their Google account via the OAuth 2.0 authorization flow. | Planned |
| 6 | Continue with GitHub (OAuth 2.0) | Allow users to sign up and log in using their GitHub account via the OAuth 2.0 authorization flow. | Planned |
| 7 | MFA via Authenticator App (TOTP) | Add two-factor authentication using a TOTP authenticator app (e.g., Google Authenticator or Authy) with QR-code enrollment. | Planned |
| 8 | OTP via Email | Send a one-time passcode to the user's registered email as a second authentication factor during login. | Planned |
| 9 | QR Code Login | Let users log in by scanning a QR code shown on the login page from an already-authenticated mobile device. | Planned |
| 10 | CAPTCHA on Login | Add a CAPTCHA (e.g., Google reCAPTCHA or hCaptcha) to the login form to block automated and bot-driven login attempts. | Planned |
| 11 | Account Lockout | Temporarily lock an account after a configured number of consecutive failed login attempts, with a cooldown timer before retry. | Planned |

## Troubleshooting

**`uv command not found`**
Install uv: `pip install uv` or see https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/

**`Port 3001 already in use`**
Kill the existing process using the commands in "Useful Commands" above.

**`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'app'`**
Run the app from the project root with `uv run backend/app/main.py`. The entry point automatically adds `backend/` to `sys.path`.

**Database seems corrupted or stale**
Delete `vulnerable_app.db` from the project root and restart the app. The database is recreated automatically on startup.
